Hello, 
Welcome to All,
This is about the project which known as "Basic Calculator" in this project, I upload four files.This project is web based so,
for creating this project I used "HTML","CSS","JAVA SCRIPT", and I upload all this three files.

For testing project Follow the following steps :
create one folder and in this folder ---> Save the Html file "Basic Calculator" ---> Save the css file "styles" ---> save the java script file "script" ---> and save the image file "bgregistration" ---> Execute the file "Basic Calculator".
Thank You !
